# COMP 361 Project

## Notice
You may notice that this repository has few commits and contributors, this is because I had to clone and republish the repository for it to be public because it was created by my professor in university. I am writing this note to explicitly state that I was not the only one who contributed to this code and give credit to my colleagues who are mentioned below.

## How to run

### Native deployment

Run the services in the following order:

- Run the LobbyService and its database, following its [instructions](LobbyService/README.md).
- Run the server and its database, following its [instructions](server/README.md).
- Run the client, following its [instructions](client/README.md).

### Docker Compose

The service interplay configuration for this Splendor implementation uses Docker-Compose.

- Docker is a virtualization technology that allows a convenient deployment (installation) of services, independent of
  the host OS. Docker deploys individual services (the modules listed above) as containers.
- The Docker-Compose configuration of this repository orchestrates module containers (correct startup sequence, network
  wiring).

> Note: You can use this docker-compose configuration on any system, no matter if a personal laptop or a headless
> server.

The following files are used for deployment:

* [```docker-compose.yml```](docker-compose.yml): Docker-Compose file to orchestrate the startup sequence and network
  wiring of containerised platform modules:
    * [```Dockerfile-ls-db```](Dockerfile-ls-db): Container build instructions for the Lobby Service Database
      module.
    * [```Dockerfile-ls-api```](Dockerfile-ls-api): Container build instructions for
      the [Lobby-Service](https://github.com/kartoffelquadrat/LobbyService) module.
    * [```Dockerfile-sp-db```](Dockerfile-sp-db): Container build instructions for the Splendor server Database
      module.
    * [```Dockerfile-sp-api```](Dockerfile-sp-api): Container build instructions for
      the [Splendor](https://github.com/COMP361/f2022-hexanome-14) server module.

### Prerequisites

#### Docker-Compose

Depending on your host-os, install docker-compose with one of the links below:

* Mac OS / Windows: [Docker Desktop (docker-compose and GUI-tools)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    * Windows: Additionally follow
      the [official instructions to install the linux kernel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps).
* Prod Systems / Linux: [Docker Compose (just docker-compose)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Code

* Clone this repository:  
  ```git clone https://github.com/COMP361/f2022-hexanome-14```

* *Recursively* pull, and re-attach all sub repositories:

    * Mac / Linux:  
      ```./updatesubmodules.sh```
    * Windows:  
      ```.\updatesubmodules.ps1```

#### Java and maven

Install [java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) version 19
and [maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to run the client.  
Here are some good instructions by Baeldung on how to install
maven: https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac  
This is also necessary if the server is being deployed natively.

### Deployment

* If you're on a Mac with M1 chip, set these environment variables:

```
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=0
```

* Power up the platform:  
  ```docker-compose up```  
  (use ```docker-compose up --build``` to force rebuild)

* Test the platform:
    * Run the client with the these [instructions](client/README.md)
    * In the running client login with a user, such as ```maex```, ```linus```, ```khabiir``` or ```marianick```, with
      the
      password: ```abc123_ABC123```
    * Create a session
    * Launch another instance of the client
    * Login as a different user to client 1
    * On client 2, join the session created by client 1
    * Launch the game on client 1
    * Join the game on client 2
    * *Play!* on both clients.
