### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

- Making sure not to build technical debt while creating features quickly due to milestones.
- Finding time to work on the project with finals
- We still need to prune some branches, we have a lot of old and un-used branches.

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

- Our weekly meetings still prove to be very helpful for steady productivity on the milestones!
- Bouncing ideas off of each other, since we have different styles, improves our idea generation
- Meeting up in-person for big milestone implementations (e.g. cascade card) proved more efficient than discord calls.
